# üîÑ Polyphase Filters: Structure, Operation, and Advantages

**Polyphase filters** are an efficient solution in digital signal processing for tasks like **decimation** (downsampling) and **interpolation** (upsampling). Instead of processing and then discarding unnecessary data, polyphase filters restructure the filter into **parallel components** to compute only what's needed ‚Äî saving significant computational effort.

| Feature                 | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Phase Decomposition** | A filter is broken into multiple sub-filters (polyphase components)         |
| **Multiple Delay Lines**| Multiple parallel paths process the input rather than one long delay line   |
| **Computational Efficiency** | Avoids computing discarded samples in decimation or interpolation           |
| **Rate Conversion**     | Ideal for downsampling and upsampling operations                           |
| **Frequency Demultiplexing** | Can split signals into frequency subbands (e.g. channelizers)            |
| **Applications**        | Used in audio, telecom, SDRs, and multirate systems                         |

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Polyphase Filters Work

### üîπ 1. Standard FIR Filtering + Downsampling (Inefficient)

A standard FIR filter applies to every input sample, even if many are later discarded:

\[
y[n] = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} h[k] \cdot x[n - k]
\]

Then you downsample:

\[
y_{\text{dec}}[n] = y[nM]
\]

This computes all output samples and **throws away (M‚àí1)/M of them**.

### üîπ 2. Polyphase Decomposition (Efficient)

The FIR filter \( h[n] \) is split into \( M \) polyphase components:

\[
h[n] = \sum_{m=0}^{M-1} e_m[n] \cdot \delta[n - m]
\]

Where each sub-filter is:

\[
e_m[n] = h[nM + m]
\]

Then the output is computed as:

\[
y[n] = \sum_{m=0}^{M-1} \sum_{k=0}^{L-1} e_m[k] \cdot x[nM - kM - m]
\]

‚úÖ This computes **only the samples that will be used**, improving efficiency dramatically.
